# WelcomeMan

###WelcomeMan is a plugin that greets players when they join the server.

Players can set their own custom name with the `/changename` command

The permissions are
* welcomeman.changename
* welcomeman.changename.others

*The development branch contains the newest version that is being developed. It may or may not even be working, therefore i do not recommend using the development version. Use the master branch for a stable release*
